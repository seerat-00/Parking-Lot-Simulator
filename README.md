# Parking-Lot-Simulator

This is a working Java Swing UI based Parking lot simulator. 
In this model, you can reserve the parking slot for 5 minutes. In those 5 minutes, the car has to be parked and occupied. Once the car is parked, it stays occupied for long time until you manually click on the leave button.
If you don't occupy within 5 minutes, the slot is set to empty again.
